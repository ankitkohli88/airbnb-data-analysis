# Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation 
For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle AIRBNB data from Kaggle to understand the following questions:

#### Time
* What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? 
* During what part of year do hosts signups the most?
#### Property 
* What kind of property types are most popular in Seattle area?
* What kind of room types are more popular in Seattle area?
#### Location
* Where in Seattle are the most hosts and super hosts (experienced hosts) located?
* What locations have the most expensive and least expensive places.

# File Descriptions
There is a notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

Also included are the data files which were downloaded from Kaggle. To answer the above business questions listings and calendar data files were used.

# Summary 
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]
